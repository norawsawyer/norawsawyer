- 👋 Hi, I’m @norawsawyer


- 👀 I’m interested in data science, using R for data analysis and visualization, and making computational biology tools more accessible to the general public. 


- 🌱 I’m currently learning a variety of programming languages through Harvard University's intro computer science course (CS50) available through EdX 
and taking coursework through Google to earn my Data Analytics certificate. 


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any research projects that involve computational biology 
that are relevant to healthcare, medicine, genome evolution in humans and nonhuman primates, and microbial genome evolution. 



- 📫 How to reach me: If you are interested in collaborating on a research project feel free to contact me via sawyern18 at ecualumni dot ecu dot edu
